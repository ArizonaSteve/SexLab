Skryim SexLab Framework
  By Ashal of Loverslab.com

    Version 1.51, released 2014/04/21

-- Description --------------------------------------------------------------

    Skyrim SexLab, is intended to serve as a unifying resource for
    modders to pull animations from to aid them in development of adult
    themed mods, without having to going through the complex scripting
    work it takes by themselves. A modder is provided with a wealth of tools
    and functions they can call that will aid them in creating their own mod.

    As it is intended as a resource mod that other mods can pull from to use
    for adult animations. This mod does NOTHING by itself, and requires a
    separate mod to make use of the resources provided.
